# Resources for doing data analysis in Python

This repository contains a collection of resources for doing data analysis in Python.  It is developed for the course _Physics 201: Data Analysis for Physicists_ at Harvard, but it may be useful to others doing applied Bayesian inference in the physical sciences and engineering.

## Resources (all TBD)
  - Getting started guide: installing your Python data-analysis tools
  - Environment files for use with conda/mamba
  - Docker images
  - Wiki and FAQ
