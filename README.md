# Resources for doing data analysis in Python

This repository contains a collection of resources for doing data analysis in Python.  It is developed for the course _Physics 201: Data Analysis for Physicists_ at Harvard, but it may be useful to others doing applied Bayesian inference in the physical sciences and engineering.

## Resources
  - [Getting started guide](https://github.com/phys201/data-analysis-in-python/wiki/Getting-started): installing and running your Python data-analysis tools
  - [Environment files](../../tree/main/environments) for use with conda/mamba
  - Docker images (TBD)
  - [Wiki and FAQ](https://github.com/phys201/data-analysis-in-python/wiki/Home)
